<strong>Joy Augustine</strong>&mdash;
Joy was a very good girl—kind, smart, and deeply loved.<p>
Before life became difficult, we shared simple moments of happiness. We used to play a hand game together while singing “Think O Think O.” Even during her hardest days, she still remembered that song. That memory lives with me.</p>
<p>
Life was not easy for Joy. She lived with struggles that many people did not understand. We took her to the hospital, hoping for answers and healing, but there was no solution. Some people treated her badly and looked down on her, hurting her when she was already vulnerable. Still, we lived each day with hope that she would get better.
 </p>
 <p>
Joy endured more pain than anyone should. She survived moments that could have taken her away, and we continued to hope. But one day, after a terrible incident at home, Joy left us.
 </p>
She was more than her struggles.
She was intelligent.
She was gentle.
She was loved.
<p>Joy Augustine will always be remembered—not for the pain she faced, but for the goodness she carried and the memories she left behind. </p>
